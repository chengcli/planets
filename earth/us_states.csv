# US States Location Table
# Format: location_id	name	polygon_vertices
# polygon_vertices format: lon1,lat1;lon2,lat2;lon3,lat3;...
# Vertices represent actual state boundaries (simplified to 13-50 vertices per state)
# Vertices are in counterclockwise order
# Longitude: negative for West, positive for East
# Latitude: negative for South, positive for North
# Note: Alaska uses extended western longitude (around -189° to -130°) for consistency
#       across the International Date Line. Scripts calculate rectangular
#       bounds from these polygons automatically.
