# Earth Location Table
# 
# This file defines geographic locations for atmospheric modeling.
# Each location has:
#   - id: Unique identifier (letters, numbers, dashes, underscores only)
#   - name: Human-readable name
#   - polygon: List of [longitude, latitude] vertices defining the geographic bounds
#   - center: [longitude, latitude] for domain center
#   - elevation: Approximate elevation in meters
#   - description: Location description
#
# Notes:
# - Simulated rectangular domain must contain the polygon bounds
# - Polygon vertices should be in counterclockwise order
# - Longitude: negative for West, positive for East
# - Latitude: negative for South, positive for North
