# US Zipcode Location Table
# Format: zipcode	polygon_vertices
# polygon_vertices format: lon1,lat1;lon2,lat2;lon3,lat3;...
# Vertices represent ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area) boundaries
# (simplified to up to 30 vertices per zipcode)
# Vertices are in counterclockwise order
# Longitude: negative for West, positive for East
# Latitude: negative for South, positive for North
# Note: ZCTAs are generalized areal representations and may not exactly
#       match postal ZIP code boundaries
